### Problems

#### Problem 1
Discuss how stacks can be used for balancing of symbols

#### Problem 2
Discuss infix to postfix conversion algorithm using stack

#### Problem 3
For a given array with n symbols how many stack permutations are possible

#### Problem 4
Discuss postfix evaluation using stacks

#### Problem 5
Can we evaluate the infix expression with stacks in one pass?

#### Problem 6
How to design a stack such that getMinimum() should be O(1)

#### Problem 7
For Problem 6 is it possible to improve the space complexity?

#### Problem 8
Given an array of characters formed with a's and b's. The string is marked with special character X which represents the middle of the list (for example: ababa...ababXbabab...baa). Check whether the string is a palindrome or not?

#### Problem 9
For the Problem 8, if input is a singly linked list then how do we check whether list elements form a palindrome or not?

#### Problem 10
Can we solve Problem 8 using stacks?

#### Problem 11
Given a stack, how to reverse the contents of stacks by using only stack operations (push and pop).

#### Problem 12
Show how to implement one queue efficiently using two stacks. Analyze the running time of queue operations.

#### Problem 13
Show how to implement one stack efficiently using two queues. Analyze the running time of stack operations.

#### Problem 14 - 2 Stacks in one array
How do we implement 2 stacks using only one array? one stack routines should not indicate exception unless every slot in the array is used.

#### Problem 15 - 3 Stacks in one array
How do we implement 3 stacks using only one array? 

#### Problem 16
For Problem 15, is there any other way of implementing middle stack?

#### Problem 17 - M Stacks in one array
How do we implement m stacks in one array?

#### Problem 18
Consider empty stack of integers. Let the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 be pushed on to this stack only in order they appeared from left to right. Let S indicates a push and X indicates a pop operation. Can they be permuted into the order 325641 (output) and order 154623? (If permutation is possible give the order string of operations)

#### Problem 19
Suppose there are two singly linked lists both of which intersect at some point and become a single linked list. The head or start pointers of both the lists are known, but the intersecting node is not known. Also, the number of nodes in each of the list before they intersect are unknown and both list may have it different. List 1 may have n nodes before it reaches intersection point and List 2 might have m nodes before it reaches intersection point where m and n may be m = n, m < n or m > n. Can we solve this problem using stacks? 

#### Problem 20
For dynamic array implementation of stack, we have used repeated doubling array approach. For the same problem what is the complexity if we create a new array whose size is n + K instead of doubling?

#### Problem 21
Given a string containing n S's amd n X's where S indicates push operation and X indicates pop operation, and with stack initially empty. Formulate a rule to check whether a given string S of operations is admissible or not?

#### Problem 22 - Finding of Spans
Given an array A the span S[i] of A[i] is the maximum number of consecutive elements A[j] immediately preceding A[i] and such that A[j] <= A[j+1]

#### Problem 23
Can we improve complexity of Problem 22?

#### Problem 24 - Largest Rectangle Under Histogram
A histogram is a polygon composed of sequence of rectangles aligned at a common base line. For simplicity, assume that the rectangles are having equal widths but h=may have different heights. For example, consider rectangles with height 3, 2, 5, 6, 1, 4, 4, measured in units where 1 is width of rectangles. Here our problem is, given an array with heights of rectangles (assuming width is 1), we need to find the largest rectangle possible. For given example shared part of 5 and 6 is the largest rectangle.

#### Problem 25
Given an algorithm for sorting a stack in ascending order. We should not make any assumptions about how stack is implemented.
