#### Problem 10
You are given a pointer to the first element of a linked list L. There are two possibilities for L, it either ends (snake) or its last element points back to one of the earlier elements in the list (snail). Task is to devise an algorithm that tests whether given list L is a snake or snail.

#### Problem 11
Check whether given linked list is either NULL terminated or not. If there is cycle find start node of the loop.

#### Problem 12
From previous problems we understand that tortoise and hares meeting concludes existence of loop, but how does moving tortoise to beginning of the linked list while keeping the hare at meeting place, followed by moving both one step at a time make them meet at starting point of cycle?

#### Problem 13
In Floyd cycle finding algorithm, does it work if we use the step 2 and 3 instead of 1 and 2?

#### Problem 14
Check whether the given linked list is either NULL-terminated or not. If there is a cycle find the length of the loop.

#### Problem 15
Insert a node in sorted linked list

#### Problem 16
Reverse a singly linked list

#### Problem 17
Suppose there are two singly linked lists both of which intersect at some point and become a single liked list. The head or start pointers of both lists are known, but the intersecting node is not known. Also number of nodes in each of the list before they intersect are unknown and both list may have it different. List 1 may have n nodes before it reaches intersection point and List 2 might have m nodes before it reaches intersecting point where m and n may be m = n, m < n or m > n. Give an algorithm for finding the merging point.

#### Problem 18
Can we solve Problem 17 using sorting techique?

#### Problem 19
Can we solve Problem 17 using hash tables?

#### Problem 20 
Can we use stacks for solving Problem 17?

#### Problem 21
Is there any other way of solving Problem 17?

#### Problem 22
Can we still think of finding alternative solution to Problem 17?

#### Problem 23
Can we improve complexity of Problem 17?

#### Problem 24
How will you find the middle of linked list?

#### Problem 25
Can we improve complexity of Problem 24?

#### Problem 26
Can we use hash table for solving Problem 24?

#### Problem 27
Can we solve Problem 26 in just one scan?

#### Problem 28
How will you display linked list from the end?

#### Problem 29
Check whether the given linked list length is even or odd

#### Problem 30
If the head of linked list is pointing to kth element, then how will you get the elements before kth element?

#### Problem 31
Given two sorted linked lists, we need to merge them into third list in sorted order

#### Problem 32 
Reverse the linked list in pairs. If you have a linked list that holds 1->2->3->4->X, then after the function has been called the linked list would hold 2->1->4->3->X

#### Problem 33
Given a binary tree convert it to doubly linked list

#### Problem 34
How do we sort Linked Lists?

#### Problem 35
If we want to concatenate two linkedlists which of the following gives O(1) complexity?
A) Singly Linked List
B) Doubly Linked List
C) Circular Doubly Linked List

#### Problem 36
Split a circular linked list into two equal parts. If number of nodes in the list are odd then mae first list one node extra than second list

#### Problem 37
How will you check if the linked list is palindrome or not?

#### Problem 38
Exchange the adjacent elements in a linked list

#### Problem 39
For a given K value (K > 0) reverse K nodes in a list

#### Problem 40
Is it possible to get O(1) access time for linked lists?

#### Problem 41 - Josephus Circle
N people have decided to elect a leader by arranging themselves in a circle and eliminating every Mth person around the circle, closing ranks as each person drops out. Find which person will be the last one remaining (with rank 1).

#### Problem 42
Given a linked list consists of data, next pointer and also a random pointer which points to a random node of the list. Give an algorithm for cloning the list.
